## ORCID

### Overview

Many funders and publishers now require you to get an [**ORCID**](https://orcid.org/): an ID that is unique to you and which comes with you wherever you go. It eliminates *ambiguity* about your name so you can get full credit for your work.

Do you have an ORCID? Are you sure how best to use it? Bring your own device to this practical session and register for an ORCID, link it to your other accounts, and find out more.



### Motivation and challenges

- **Sharing** and **searching** research work effectively
    :mag_right::
  - How to share *all* your academic work (publications, grants, data sets, patents, teaching materials ...)?
  - How to find the work of others?


- How to manage your list of works when **moving between institutions**? ... and keeping it updated too? Your email address will soon expire after you leave the university :sweat:

- A name is not enough. **Name ambiguity** impedes unique identification of researchers :dancers:. This ambivalence is spread across cultures: James Smith, Zhang Li, María García ... Names have variations, change over time and are often expressed in different ways in different situations or languages.

### Features

- Names are not enough to ensure credit for your work -> ORCID ids are unique and persistent identifiers specifically for researchers, analysts and scholars :clap:

- ORCID is a nonprofit organisation so users own the data linked to their identifier so have full control over what data are linked to their id, and how those data are made public, limited or private.

- Unlike email addresses, if you leave the university, the ORCID travels with you, along with your list of past activities.
