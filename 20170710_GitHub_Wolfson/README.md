## What is git? What is github? What is version control?

[Github](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) is web-based git:

- git: version control system that enables you to store a set of files, as well the list of changes made to those files (https://git-scm.com/).
- web-based: internet hosting service

Changes are usually identified by a number named the *revision number*. Each revision is associated with a *timestamp* and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.

Version control systems are frequently used for groups writing software and code, but can be used for any kind of files or projects.

Another software for version control is subversion ([svn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion))


### Public (free) and private repositories

A user has to create an account in order to contribute content to the site, but public repositories can be browsed and downloaded by anyone.

Pricing of plans for [private repositories](https://github.com/pricing). Developer plan is free for [students](https://education.github.com/pack).

There are alternatives to github, e.g. gitlab, which uses a different business model with free private repositories and cost plans for public ones.
