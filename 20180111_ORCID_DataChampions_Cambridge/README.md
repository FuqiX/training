## ORCID

### Overview

Many funders and publishers now require you to get an [**ORCID**](https://orcid.org/): an ID that is unique to you and which comes with you wherever you go. It eliminates *ambiguity* about your name so you can get full credit for your work.
Do you have an ORCID? Are you sure how best to use it? Your Department of Chemistry [Data Champions](http://www-library.ch.cam.ac.uk/data-champions) are offering a practical, 30 minute session where you can bring your own device and register for an ORCID, link it to your other accounts, and find out more.
