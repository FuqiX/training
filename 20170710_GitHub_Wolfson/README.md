## What is git? What is github? What is version control?

Web-based git:

- git: Repository that enables you to store a set of files, as well the list of changes made to those files (version control) (https://git-scm.com/).
- Web-based: internet hosting service

Changes are usually identified by a number named the "revision number". Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged. 

Version control systems like subversion (svn) and git are frequently used for groups writing software and code, but can be used for any kind of files or projects.
